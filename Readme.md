# Image Classification with CNNs

Welcome to the "Image Classification with CNNs" project repository! This project is a deep dive into the world of computer vision and deep learning. Our goal is to create a powerful image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can recognize and categorize objects within images with impressive accuracy.

## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Dive into the heart of computer vision with a state-of-the-art CNN architecture designed to learn and extract intricate features from images.

- **Dataset**: Utilize the popular CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across ten distinct categories. The dataset is perfectly suited for training our image classifier.

- **Training**: Train the CNN model from scratch, allowing it to learn patterns and features that distinguish objects in images.

- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of your model with essential metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualize the training process to observe improvements.

- **Custom Image Classification**: Test your model on custom images to see its practical application beyond the training data.
